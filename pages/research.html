        <p>My research interests focus on how black people interpret and perform their racial identity, the
processes by which they create community based on these understandings, and the significance
of place and space in shaping these sentiments. The bulk of my research employs ethnographic
methods to uncover what blacks think constitutes an “authentic” racial identity, how they signal
this to others in everyday interaction, and how racially exclusive places shape understandings
and performances of race. I am also interested in how race and gender identities interact. My
interest in the intersection of race, space, gender, and culture underlies my book (under contract,
University of Chicago Press), which centers on a black barbershop in Brooklyn, and my new
research on black beauty salons.</P>

<h3 >The Black Community & Barbershop</h3>

<p >It is common to hear people reference “the black community” in academia, the media, political
discourse, and everyday conversations. Social scientists have demonstrated that all communities
are imagined in a sense. Nevertheless, invoking the idea of a black community produces
tangible effects (e.g. vote or protest). But does a recognizable black community exist in America
today? If so, what appearance and form does it take? Is blackness the sole determinant of
membership? How is social solidarity along the lines of blackness created, maintained, and
policed?</p>

<p >I began to address these questions by analyzing black and white people’s general sentiments
about racial solidarity as expressed in a nationally representative dataset. In a paper being
prepared for publication, “A Quantitative Measure of Black and White Differences in the
Perception of Community,” I use data from the General Social Survey 2000-2010 (GSS), to test
the idea that racial status alone is enough to generate a sense of closeness for black people. I also
test whether blacks report a heightened sense of racial relatedness compared to whites. I find
that, even after controlling for mediators of racial solidarity such as class, sex, age, religion, and
region, both of the aforementioned hypotheses are supported. In other words, I find some
statistical evidence that blacks do imagine themselves as part of a community, even in the
absence of personal acquaintanceship. This study also demonstrated that people who are marked
by race (non-whites) in the U.S. are more likely than whites to consciously think about their race
in their everyday lives. These findings beg the question: How do blacks achieve racial solidarity
in everyday life? Is an imagined black community premised largely on phenotype, or on a
presumption of shared experiences and understandings? Where can one find social
manifestations of a black community?</p>

<p>These questions, which cannot be easily answered through surveys, motivated my dissertation,
now a book manuscript in progress, “Shaping Community: Black Men in the Barbershop,” an
ethnography of a black barbershop in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, New York. I chose to focus on
an institution that is historically recognized as being significant to “the black community,” the
barbershop, to examine how the people who gather there talk about race and about what creates a
sense of racial relatedness between them. My book offers an empirical study of how black
men who gather in a barbershop think about and enact their racial and gender identity. I also
illustrate how the barbershop, as a pre-designated racial and gender exclusive place, structures
these performances.</p>

<p>Shaping Community is based on three years of participant observation and dozens of interviews
with patrons and barbers, including the owners of surrounding barbershops (to get a more
comprehensive picture of the role of black barbershops in the social life of the neighborhood).
My book argues that blackness and racial relatedness are a situated interactional achievement,
and that places like the barbershop become moral spaces that invoke and shape racial
performances. Using W.E.B. Du Bois’ classic concept of the double consciousness, I illustrate
how black men perceive their beliefs, values, and practices in relation and in opposition to
whites. I also show how they use the barbershop as a “racial backstage” to work on issues of
individual and collective black identities in the absence of white scrutiny. Specifically, I find
that the men use talk that identifies whites as the (often morally inferior) “other,” self-critique,
storytelling, and mentorship to construct their values and culture as distinctly “black.” And I
show how the barbershop facilitates the men’s efforts to discuss, affirm, and police what they say
constitutes an authentic black male identity.</p>

<h3>Future Research: The Black Beauty Salon </h3>

<p>I became interested in the topic of the beauty salon while conducting my dissertation fieldwork.
My personal experience with being a patron in a black beauty salon for over twenty-five years
helped me realize how the racial performances I witnessed in the barbershop were distinctly
masculine ones. In order to analyze gender differences in racial performance, I have begun an
ethnography of a comparable black beauty salon. </p>
